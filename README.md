Rails version: 5.2.4

The app lets users create different playlists and add any songs they'd like to them using Deezer's API. It also allows them to view all their songs and correlating playlists. 
It is entirely responsive without the use of Bootstrap, including a hamburger menu for easy mobile navigation. All responsive features are in the @media tags in CSS.

IMPORTANT: It's very important to seed first before starting the app.

A result is a search result and there should not be more than 1 at any given time. It contains all the songs that are related to the user's keyword when a search is done. When another search occurs, the existing one is deleted (along with all of the related songs) and another one is created with the same id (1).
